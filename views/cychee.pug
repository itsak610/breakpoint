    | After a year, we had finally found the solution to get out. For a year, I had been searching for a way out of my place. Well obviously, I was not going anywhere, or... was I ? It had been so long since I had even thought about getting out of here. I had thought about going out before Ayudh and Aagosh came. Yes, at first, I was irritated by them, but then they opened my world. I was so immersed in searching for a way out with them, that I forgot they would go to their world if we actually found a way out. And now, here we were with the solution. I had never in my life, ever felt lonely, but now as the way out lay in front of us, I had mixed feelings. I wasn't sure whether to go back to my place and chill out... <em>alone</em> or to go with them to an entire new world. <br><br> The portal room was actually quite simple in design. It was plain white and had four ports connecting to a ring. Each port was connected to a floating video player. When we entered the room it was obvious that this was the portal that would allow them to leave. Obvious because before entering this room we saw a green exit sign pointing here xD. We approached the first video player and touched on the play button. A video started playing and when it ended we got sucked into the player. The video started playing in a loop as we were in it. The first few times we did not understand what to do and then we accidently found a letter <b>~C~</b> in it. We went through each video and finally found these letters: <br><br> <h3 class='center'>~C~ ~N~ ~C~ ~Y~</h3> <br><br> After rearranging the letters we got a very interesting word. I don't think I need to tell you what that word is. We rearranged the video players in the similar order and the portal charged up. We waited for a while but nothing happened. We realized that the portal did not have enough power and we needed some from their world too. Ayudh and I went to find a way to send a message to their world and somehow we finally did send one. A few days later, the portal's power increased suddenly. We immediately got alert as the portal started expanding. Aagosh ran up behind the ring and held it fast as its power was continuously increasing. Soon a singularity started forming behind us and grew as the portal's power increased. The singularity started pulling us away from the portal. I shouted, "Ayudh go! We don't have time. This... This singularity thing is pulling me, I will give you a push." Ayudh shouted, "What about Aagosh and what... what about you, man?" Aagosh shouted, "Ayudh, forget about us. Just tell the other cypherites about Cyche and me." Before he could complain, I pushed Ayudh into the portal and just as he went through it, the portal snapped close and Aagosh flew towards me as we got sucked into the singularity.
