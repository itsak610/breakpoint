    | It started out with two guys. I was sitting there enjoying, chillaxing and listening to music. These two guys were, as they told me, walking to their classes when suddenly they saw a <em>(c)</em> in the air. Just like every other human, they got curious and tried to touch the hologram. Obviously, curiosity got the cat. They disappeared from their world... and came to my world. At first, I was irritated by these two pests as they came into my world. Just a moment ago, I was, as I said, enjoying, chillaxing and listening to music and now I had to answer every question they had. And boy, did they pester me! "Who are you?", "Where are we?", "Why are we here?" As a few hours passed, they became less curious until one of them asked, "How do we go back?" to which I replied, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ "Who knows, I have never tried"

    | A few days passed and the pests had still not left. They always went out in search of some way to go back and returned with disappointed faces. One day, I told them I will help them. I did so not because I wanted them to go but in a few days their activities had piqued my curiosity. I wanted to see how they would behave in certain situations. So I tagged along with them the next day. Since I had never bothered to go somewhere else, they took me to a small room. Completely red, the room had a platform floating in the air. We got to the platform and at the edge of the platform there was a huge pit. It was pitch black and did not look safe. Standing there, right at the edge, we got the chills and backed off. I said, "Well, that does not look like a way out to me." We thought for some time, looked around at the room and finally one of the guy, the one with the spectacles remarked, "Well, blue would have been better." The walls suddenly changed its colour to blue. We were taken aback and suddenly a very <strike>obvious</strike> brilliant idea came to me. "Hey what if the room is voice controlled?" The other one, who had been quiet for some time said, "Maybe there is a voice-code for finding a way out." I said, "I don't think it will work like that." The spectacled guy said, "What's the harm in trying?" He walked up to the edge and said, "Start." We waited... and nothing happened. I said, "Heh! I told you it won't initialize like that- " The wall in front of us suddenly pixelized and started separating. As we looked in awe, the wall separated to show a white room. The pit in front of us disappeared and instead it became a solid platform just like the one we were standing on. The platform connected us to the white room. As we walked into the room, slowly words began to form in the air. With a new strange feeling, a feeling I had never felt before, we looked at the words:
